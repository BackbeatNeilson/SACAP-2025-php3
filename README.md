# 📘 Appendices C & D: Statistical Procedures and Outputs

This repository accompanies a research proposal investigating the relationship between AI usage and self-efficacy in undergraduate students.

It contains:

- `AI-Usage-and-Self-efficacy.Rmd` – A fully annotated R Markdown source file that outlines the data analysis workflow proposed in the study.
- `AI-Usage-and-Self-efficacy.html` – An interactive HTML notebook version for easier reading and demonstration.

## 🔍 Purpose of These Files

These files serve as:

- **Appendix C**: Detailed methodological descriptions of the statistical procedures proposed in the study.
- **Appendix D**: The complete R code syntax and demonstrative outputs that support methodological transparency.

Together, they support reproducibility, clarify statistical methods, and provide interpretation scaffolding for both technical and non-technical reviewers.
