# 📘 Appendix F: Statistical Procedures and Outputs

This repository accompanies a research proposal investigating the relationship between AI usage and self-efficacy in undergraduate students.

It contains:

- `AI-Usage-and-Self-efficacy.Rmd` – A fully annotated R Markdown source file that outlines the data analysis workflow proposed in the study. That file can be accessed by selecting the following link [AI-Usage-and-Self-efficacy.Rmd – annotated R Markdown source](https://backbeatneilson.github.io/SACAP-2025-php3/AI%20Usage%20and%20Self-efficacy.Rmd)
- `AI-Usage-and-Self-efficacy.html` – An interactive HTML notebook version for easier reading and demonstration. That file can be accessed by selecting the following link [AI-Usage-and-Self-efficacy.html](AI-Usage-and-Self-efficacy.html)
